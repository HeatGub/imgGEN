The product should appear in a close-up shot, centered, and filling most of the frame. 
Use a plain white background, soft lighting, and subtle shadows to emphasize depth and texture. 
Preserve the original product's shape, material, colors and labels.
Preserving the exact label text, placement, and visual identity is crucial.
The goal is to use this for an advertisement â€” it must look clean, sharp, and text must be readable."""
